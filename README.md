## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this module is to understand the capabilities of Javascript, building a dynamic webpage is quite a challenge, but it can provide useful insights to a large amount of people at the same time, and almost from anywhere.

We are helping Dana who is a Data journalist to display Data about UFO's, using filters we'll give to users the power to look for specific information. Date, City and even the shape of the UFO can be used to filter this project.

## Results:
You can make as specific searches as you wish in this webpage. You can filter by Date, City, State, Country and Shape.

The way you can do it is by typing the information you are looking for and pressing "Enter".

Here are some examples:

### Date: 
You need to enter date as per the example shown in the search bar which is "1/10/2010"

### City, State, Country and Shape:
These filters work in a similar way, just by typing the info you are looking and information will be displayed.

You can even try to filter simultaneously like in this example:

## Summary:

One disadvantage we notice while building this site is that the user has to type the exact information as it is shown in the data.js in order to obtain information, one way to improve this can be by allowing to filter by month or even by year in the "Date" Field.

As additional recommendations we can make the filtering more intuitive to have a better UX. Some webpages show you the data as you are entering the information even without pressing enter. This helps the user to make sure it is being typed correctly and also presents other matches to the initial request.

We need to think always in the final user, so maybe some graphs to summarize the data can be helpful in order to give quick insights that can help the user make a better search.
